This theme inspired from Codecademy editor and Google Material design.

It is converted from my [Sublime Text version](https://github.com/hrsetyono/theme_pacific) that is based on [Monokai Extended](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/sublime-monokai-extended).

Also thank you to everyone who have given feedbacks and reported some bugs.
